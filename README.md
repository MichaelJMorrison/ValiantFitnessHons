## About the Project

The project was created to evaluate what features enable the retention of users in a fitness application. This application was made using Android Studio Hedgehog (2023) and is **only for Android Users**.

The application contains 4 key pages:
- Workout
- Tracker
- Profile
- Social

The Workout page allows users to access a library of exercises and workout plans and create their own based on the existing library of exercises.

The Tracker Page allows users to track multiple categories of data including; Calories, Weight, Steps Taken (if enabled), and Total Volume Lifted. The page also displays 3 of the user's best-set weights. 

The Profile Page allows users to set up a profile for social interaction and see badges they have collected over their continuous usage of the application.

The Social Page allows users to be able to search for help or decide to find users to help. When they send out a ping a user can accept the user and the user will be informed that someone is on their way to help them.

## Installation
To install the application you will need to install the following onto your Android Phone.

When prompted you will be asked to install from an unknown app. You must go into your settings and allow installation from certain applications (eg chrome, your files).

Once installed you are good to begin usage.

  - Social Leaderboard corresponding to your local area
  - Improved Social Help Finder (Proper User Display and needs)
